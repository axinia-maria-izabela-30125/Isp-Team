# Group lab

Steps for resolving lab:
- Create a team of 4 or 5 students
- Create a git repository and add team members to it
- Choose one of the samples c1, c2, ..., c5 as the starting point for your project and copy cX-sample content to your repository
- Create a private post on piazza and share it with instructors presenting repository link and team members;
- For selected project:
    * create UML Use-Case diagram;
    * create UML class diagram;
    * fix the implementation so that all tests pass;
    * design a minimal user interface (UI) for the program and implement it using Swing;
    * try to apply MVC design pattern in implementing the UI;
- Try to work as a team and each member of the team to resolve part of the problem

**Note 1 - This lab does not count to the final lab grade. It just gives you a chance to experiment how you can work in collaboration on a git repository.**

**Note 2 - Please notice that for this lab there is NO assignment template and you will need to create repository from scratch in github.**
